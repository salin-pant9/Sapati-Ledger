# Sapati-Ledger
Sapati Ledger is a simple mobile application which uses `go` as a backend.
It stores data of loan borrower and automatically calculates their total amount to pay.

## List of things user need to do:-
1. First User need to login to the application creating profile.
2. Then anyone who takes `sapati` they can be added.
3. Based on the need of borrower `sapati` is approved and given.

After these the applicationa automatically calculates the total amount the borrower need to pay to the lender.
- Reason for making of this application is that for small `sapati` lenders, it is hard for them to look for all those data.
- This application simply lists all those money borrowers and shows who has to pay what amount of money.
